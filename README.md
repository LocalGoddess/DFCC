# DFCC

DiamondFire C Compiler - it's not *that* stupid

## Purpose

The purpose of DFCC is to compile C source code into Hypercube templates to be run on DiamondFire.

### What is DiamondFire

DiamondFire is a minecraft server where players can create their own mini-games using a block based programming system.
Players can transfer code between each other using code templates. You can join DiamondFire using the ip
mcdiamondfire.com.

## Current Goal

The current goal for DFCC is to have it fully compile the example code in [examples/test_one.c](examples/example_one.c).
Once that is done it is safe to assume the core parts of the compiler are done

## Goal For Release

The goal for release (version 1.0) is to be able to successfully compile C11 code into Hypercube(DiamondFire) templates.
One of the last things to be finished for released will be the preprocessor but that's fine.
